            <p> Fashion styles from decades ago are becoming more and more popular everyday. In the store there is a
                whole section dedicated to clothes inspired by the 70s! These range from dresses to blouses and so much
                more. Grab your shopping bag and walk out of the store like a 70s fashion icon! </p>

                    range of different styles and are perfect to use during spring or fall! </p>
